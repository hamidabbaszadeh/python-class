# Farmer’s problem

With the planting season steadily approaching, 
your farmer friend presents you with the following problem.

You have 3 tons of potato seeds and 4 tons of carrot seeds.
To grow the crops efficiently, you also have 5 tons of fertilizer,
which has to be used when planting in a 1:1 ratio (i.e. 1 kilogram 
of potatoes or carrots requires 1 kilogram of fertilizer). The 
profit is 1.2$/kg for potato seeds and 1.7$/kg1.7 for carrot seeds.

How much potatoes and carrots should you plant to maximize your profit this season?
